    <div class="faq-list">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Why should I use a buyer's agent?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">A buyer's agent works exclusively for you, not the seller. We provide unbiased market insights, access to off-market properties, expert negotiation, and handle all the complex due diligence. Real estate agents give our clients preference because they know our buyers are serious and finance-approved. There's no risk of the deal falling through.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How much do buyer's agents cost?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">Our fees are transparent and based on purchase price: typically 2-3% in Queensland (Brisbane & Gold Coast) and under 5% in Bali. There are no hidden costs, and our service includes everything from initial search to settlement support.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Do buyer's agents actually save me money?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Our expert negotiation skills and market knowledge regularly save clients tens of thousands of dollars. We recently saved a family over $100,000 on their Burleigh Waters purchase. Plus, we help you avoid costly mistakes by identifying issues during due diligence.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Can you help me at auction?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely. We attend auctions on your behalf, develop strategic bidding plans, and use our negotiation expertise to secure properties. We also help negotiate with sellers before auction day to potentially secure properties off-market.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Do you work with interstate buyers?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Many of our clients are interstate buyers relocating to Queensland. We handle all inspections, coordinate with local tradespeople for reports, and provide detailed property assessments so you can buy with confidence without being physically present.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between on-market and off-market properties?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">On-market properties are publicly listed on realestate.com.au and Domain. Off-market properties are available before public listing or sold privately. We have access to both. Our deep relationships with local agents give you first access to off-market opportunities that most buyers never see.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How long does the buying process take?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">We don't operate on strict timeframes. Whether it takes 3 weeks or 3 months, we're committed to finding you the perfect property. On average, our clients secure their property within 4-6 weeks, but it depends on your specific requirements and market conditions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What areas do you cover?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">We service all of Queensland (Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, and regional areas) as well as Bali, Indonesia for investment properties. Our team has deep local knowledge across all these markets.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Who do you typically work with?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">We help time-poor professionals, interstate buyers, first home buyers (from $550,000), upgraders, investors, and luxury buyers (up to $7,000,000+). If you're serious about buying property in Queensland or Bali, we can help.</p>
