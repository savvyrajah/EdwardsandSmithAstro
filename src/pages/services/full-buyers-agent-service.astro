            <h3>Save Time & Reduce Stress</h3>
            <p>
              Property searching is time-consuming. Between work, family, and other commitments, how many
              inspections can you realistically attend each week? We do this full-time, attending dozens
              of inspections and evaluating hundreds of properties on behalf of our clients.

          <div class="why-item">
            <h3>Access Off-Market Properties</h3>
            <p>
              Many of the best properties never reach public listings. Agents contact us first with
              off-market and pre-market opportunities because they know we represent serious, finance-approved
              buyers ready to move quickly.

            <h3>Expert Negotiation Saves Money</h3>
            <p>
              Our clients save an average of $65,000 through professional negotiation. We remove the emotion
              from the process and negotiate based on data, market knowledge, and proven strategies. Already found a property and just need <a href="/services/property-evaluation-negotiation">expert evaluation and negotiation support</a>? Our fee
              often pays for itself through better pricing alone.

              We've seen every issue imaginable: hidden structural problems, zoning restrictions, overpriced
              properties in declining markets. Our due diligence process protects you from expensive mistakes
              that could cost tens of thousands to rectify.

              possible price.

              best timing and pricing strategies.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does the property search typically take?</h3>
            <p>
              The timeline varies based on your requirements and market conditions. Some clients find their
              property within 2-4 weeks, while others with very specific criteria may take 2-3 months. We
              work at your pace and won't pressure you to purchase until you've found the right property.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I pay your fee if we don't find a property?</h3>
            <p>
              Our fee is success-based. You only pay when you successfully purchase a property through our
              service. If we don't find a suitable property or you choose not to proceed with a purchase,
              you don't pay our buyers agent fee.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can you help with interstate purchases?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely. Many of our clients are interstate or even overseas buyers. We become your eyes
              and ears on the ground, attending inspections, coordinating due diligence, and managing the
              entire purchase process remotely on your behalf.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What areas do you cover in Queensland?</h3>
            <p>
              We primarily service Brisbane, Gold Coast, and Sunshine Coast regions. We also work in Bali
              for property purchases. If you're looking in a specific area outside these regions, contact
              us to discuss whether we can assist.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does your fee work with the purchase price?</h3>
            <p>
              Our fee ranges from 2-3% of the purchase price depending on property value and complexity.
              For example, on a $1M property, our fee would typically be $20,000-$30,000. We provide a
              clear quote upfront before you engage our services.

            <h3>Can I attend inspections with you?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, you're welcome to attend inspections with us. However, one of the benefits of our service
              is that we can attend on your behalf, saving you time. We provide detailed reports, photos,
              and videos so you can make informed decisions without attending every inspection.
