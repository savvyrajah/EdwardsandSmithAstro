          <h2>Why You Need Someone Else to Negotiate for You</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">The psychology of property negotiation</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reasons-grid">
          <div class="reason-item">
            <h3>Emotion Clouds Judgment</h3>
            <p>
              You're emotionally invested. You've already imagined living in this property, decorating
              the rooms, hosting friends in the backyard. This emotional attachment makes it nearly
              impossible to negotiate objectively. A professional negotiator has zero emotional connection
              to the property—just a clear strategy and a maximum price based on market data.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="reason-item">
            <h3>The Agent Isn't On Your Side</h3>
            <p>
              The selling agent represents the vendor, not you. Their job is to get the highest possible
              price. They're trained negotiators who do this every day. Going up against them alone puts
              you at a significant disadvantage. We level the playing field with professional representation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="reason-item">
            <h3>You Don't Know What You Don't Know</h3>
            <p>
              How do you know if $850,000 is a good price or $50,000 too much? What leverage do you have
              if there are property issues? What terms should you negotiate beyond price? Professional
              negotiators know the market, understand leverage points, and can identify opportunities
              you'd never see.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="reason-item">
            <h3>Fear of Losing the Property</h3>
            <p>
              The fear of missing out is a powerful motivator. Agents use this against buyers: "There's
              another buyer very interested." "We have multiple offers." "The vendor needs an answer today."
              These pressure tactics work because you're afraid of losing the property. A professional
              negotiator doesn't fear losing—if the price isn't right, we walk away and find you something
              better.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="reason-item">
            <h3>Relationship Preservation</h3>
            <p>
              Maybe you found the property through a friend, or you've built rapport with the selling
              agent. Now you're worried that tough negotiation might damage these relationships. A
              professional negotiator has no such concerns—we negotiate hard without the personal baggage.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="reason-item">
            <h3>Our Fee Pays for Itself</h3>
            <p>
              Professional negotiation typically saves buyers $30,000-$100,000. Even our most expensive
              service fee is a fraction of the savings we achieve. You're not spending money on our
              service—you're making money through better pricing and terms.

            <h3>Market Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              We analyze recent comparable sales, current market conditions, and property-specific
              factors to determine true market value and establish a negotiation range.

            <p>
              Thorough inspection identifies issues, maintenance needs, or features that become
              leverage points in negotiation. Every flaw is a reason to adjust the price.

            <h3>I've already made an offer. Can you still help?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Even if you've made an initial offer, we can step in to handle counter-negotiations
              and contract terms. The earlier you engage us, the better, but we can add value at any
              stage of the negotiation process.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much can you really save me?</h3>
            <p>
              Our clients typically save $30,000-$100,000 through professional negotiation. The exact
              amount depends on the property, market conditions, and identified issues. Even conservative
              negotiation usually saves more than our service fee.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if I've already built rapport with the agent?</h3>
            <p>
              That's common, and it's exactly why you need professional representation. Your rapport
              makes it harder to negotiate aggressively. We maintain professional relationships while
              negotiating firmly on your behalf—it's what we do every day.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you negotiate on all property types?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. We negotiate on houses, apartments, townhouses, land, and commercial properties
              across Queensland. Each property type requires different negotiation strategies, which
              we tailor accordingly.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if the vendor won't negotiate?</h3>
            <p>
              Some vendors are firm on price. In these cases, we negotiate contract terms, settlement
              dates, inclusions, or conditions to add value. If the vendor truly won't budge and the
              price exceeds market value, we'll advise you to walk away and find a better opportunity.
