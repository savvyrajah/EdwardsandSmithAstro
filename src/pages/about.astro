          <p>
            Edwards & Smith Buyers Agents was founded by former AFL players Jake Edwards and Ely Smith, who discovered their shared passion for property while playing professional football. During their careers, both Jake and Ely invested heavily in property, recognizing it as a path to long-term financial security. This early experience gave them deep insights into market trends, property valuation, and the challenges buyers face.
          </p>
          <p>
            After transitioning from professional sport, they combined their discipline, strategic thinking, and team-first mentality with their property expertise to create Edwards & Smith. What started as two mates helping fellow AFL players find homes has grown into a trusted buyers agency serving families, investors, and professionals across Queensland, South Australia, and Bali.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, our team of expert buyers agents brings decades of combined experience, helping clients navigate the property market with transparency, authenticity, and proven results. <a href="/team" class="text-link">Meet our full team →</a>

              "Jake's assistance and guidance through the process of buying my first home was excellent and it allowed myself to get an understanding of what the market was doing and what the process was to securing my first home. Jake was very proactive with sending me properties that fit my criteria and he was able to take action relatively quickly which allowed me to secure my property in camp hill in a market where properties are in high demand. The process once I found my home was made so much easier and Jake did a good job of negotiating the price for my property. Jake was awesome to work with!"

You took our brief and delivered in a very competitive market sourcing properties we were not aware were even on the market. This insight gave us an opportunity to negotiate early and secure our Burleigh heads property. Buying into an interstate market during these challenging times you supported us with outstanding service and care and we couldn't have achieved this outcome without you. Thanks again"
