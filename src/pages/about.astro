              His professional skills and attributes as a respected team player in AFL have been invaluable in supporting his clients. Ely brings the same dedication and team-first mentality from his football career to helping clients across Queensland navigate their property journey.

              "Jake's assistance and guidance through the process of buying my first home was excellent and it allowed myself to get an understanding of what the market was doing and what the process was to securing my first home. Jake was very proactive with sending me properties that fit my criteria and he was able to take action relatively quickly which allowed me to secure my property in camp hill in a market where properties are in high demand. The process once I found my home was made so much easier and Jake did a good job of negotiating the price for my property. Jake was awesome to work with!"

You took our brief and delivered in a very competitive market sourcing properties we were not aware were even on the market. This insight gave us an opportunity to negotiate early and secure our Burleigh heads property. Buying into an interstate market during these challenging times you supported us with outstanding service and care and we couldn't have achieved this outcome without you. Thanks again"
