          <!-- Tip 1: Financial Pre-Approval -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">1</div>
            <h3>Financial Pre-Approval</h3>
            <p>
              Making sure your finances are ready is extremely important when purchasing a property in Brisbane. With the market moving so fast, it is important to have all your ducks in a row before you submit any offers. This is a MUST before you bid at auction due to all auctions being under unconditional terms here in Queensland.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recommend sitting down with your preferred finance broker and working through your options and identifying your budget and preferred purchase price. A position of pre-approval is seen as a position of strength in the Brisbane market.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Tip 2: Queensland Auction Rules -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">2</div>
            <h3>Bidding at Auction in Queensland</h3>
            <p>
              If you are bidding on a house at auction you must be aware of the conditions on which you are accepting. Here in Queensland auction terms are unconditional that include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>No finance clauses</li>
              <li>No building and pest clauses</li>
              <li>Waiving off of 5 day cooling off period</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once the hammer drops by the auctioneer the winning bidder immediately owns the property and there is no clause that protects the buyer to pull out of that contract. So, before you bid at an auction make sure you have the finance approval by your broker to participate.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Tip 3: No Price Guides -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">3</div>
            <h3>No Price Guides in Queensland</h3>
            <p>
              One of the greatest frustrations that interstate buyers experience when attempting to buy property in Brisbane is the lack of price guide information they receive from the sale agents. This is because there are no legal requirements for sale agents to give this information to buyers. This can create a frenzy of misguided offers and drive the price up for the seller.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Here are 3 tips to find your own price guide:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Research and find the last 3 recent sales within 4km of the property you are wanting to buy</li>
              <li>Make sure the properties you find are similar in block size, internal size and layout</li>
              <li>Call 3 other sale agents who sell homes in the area and ask their opinion on what the property may be worth</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="tip-number">4</div>
            <h3>Due Diligence & Contracts</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike some other states, Queensland sellers do not need to give any previous or existing information about their property to the interested buyers. It is up to the buyers to complete their own due diligence on the property before they make an offer.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Here are some examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you are purchasing a property that is advertised as a dual occupancy home, you want to make sure that this has been approved by council and the seller has the correct permits and paperwork in place.</li>
              <li>Some properties may have had extensions or renovation work completed. Are they compliant and certified? This information and documentation will be approved by council and the seller will have these documents.</li>
              <li>If you are purchasing a house and would like to add another story, add a carport or even extend the home we suggest you engage with a town planner to ensure these can be completed and allowed by council.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Required certificates and documentation that the seller must supply:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Smoke alarms must be compliant and certified</li>
              <li>If there is a swimming pool on the property then a certificate of safety and compliance should be supplied</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Tip 5: Building & Pest -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">5</div>
            <h3>Building & Pest Reports</h3>
            <p>
              As I am sure you would have heard, termites exist in Brisbane! Therefore, we always recommend that you make your offer subject to a 7-day building and pest report, or if the property you want to buy is going to auction you complete your own building and pest inspection beforehand if the seller has not had one completed already.
            </p>
            <p><strong>If your report comes back with any major defects or major termite damage, you have 3 options:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>You can terminate your contract and walk away from the purchase. You will receive your deposit back in full.</li>
              <li>You can have your conveyancer request a price adjustment to account for the major defect work that will be required on the property.</li>
              <li>Or; you can request that the seller attends these issues before settlement</li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Negotiating Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to negotiating with sale agents in Brisbane we recommend you utilize these 3 strategies to help you secure your new home.
          </p>

          <div class="strategy">
            <h4>1. Make a Ghost Offer</h4>
            <p>
              What does this mean? Do not be scared to put an offer on an EOI form and sign it. Unless your offer is on a formal contract and signed, it is not a legal agreement. Making a ghost offer will immediately ensure you get feedback from the sales agent in regard to what the seller is expecting for the home. From here you can begin the process in negotiating with a better understanding of the seller's expectations.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <h4>2. Submit Your Offer with Evidence</h4>
            <p>
              Submit your offer on email alongside 3 property links to recent sales in the area. Use these properties to justify your offer and give the sales agent what they need to groom the seller for your offer. The sales agent wants to sell the home, the more information you give them regarding recent sales and market statistics the better your offer will come across. Help them do their job!
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <h4>3. Find Out Why They Are Selling</h4>
            <p><strong>Some main reasons are:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Downsizing OR Upgrading</li>
              <li>Moving for work or lifestyle</li>
              <li>Financial stress</li>
              <li>Purchased somewhere else and need to sell</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This can help you position your offer that best suits the seller's needs. For example; if the seller has purchased somewhere else they will be in need for a quick settlement and would prefer a cash offer. Knowing the answer to this important question can help you leverage your offer and convince the seller to take your offer.

            <h4>How Our Fees Are Structured</h4>
            <p>
              At Edwards & Smith, transparency is paramount. Our <a href="/services/full-buyers-agent-service">full buyers agent service</a> fee ranges from 2-3% of the purchase price depending on property value and complexity. We provide a clear quote upfront before you engage our services.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, on a $1M property, our fee would typically be $20,000-$30,000. Our fee is success-based—you only pay when you successfully purchase a property through our service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike other services, we don't operate within strict timeframes. Whether the search takes three weeks or three months, our commitment remains unwavering. We will tirelessly pursue the perfect property for each and every client, ensuring their satisfaction and peace of mind throughout the process.
