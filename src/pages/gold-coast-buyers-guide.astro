          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">1</div>
            <h3>Financials Pre-Approved</h3>
            <p>
              Making sure your finances are ready is extremely important when purchasing a property on the Gold Coast. With the market moving so fast it is important to have all your ducks in a row before you submit any offers. This is a MUST before you bid at auction due to all auctions being under unconditional terms here in Queensland (we cover this more in the next section).
            </p>
            <p>
              We recommend sitting down with your preferred finance broker and working through your options and identifying your budget and preferred purchase price. A position of pre-approval is seen as a position of strength in the Gold Coast market.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Tip 2: Queensland Auction Rules -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">2</div>
            <h3>Bidding at Auction</h3>
            <p>
              If you are bidding on a house at auction you must be aware of the conditions on which you are accepting. Here in Queensland auction terms are unconditional that include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>No finance clauses</li>
              <li>No building and pest clauses</li>
              <li>And; Waiving off of 5 day cooling off period</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once the hammer drops by the auctioneer the winning bidder immediately owns the property and there is no clause that protects the buyer to pull out of that contract. So, before you bid at an auction make sure you have the finance approval by your broker to participate.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Tip 3: No Price Guides -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">3</div>
            <h3>No Price Guides</h3>
            <p>
              One of the greatest frustrations that interstate buyers experience when attempting to buy property here on the Gold Coast is the lack of price guide information they receive from the sale agents. This is because there are no legal requirements for sale agents to give this information to buyers. This can create a frenzy of miss guided offers and drive the price up for the seller. This is a technique used by the sale agents to create competition.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Here are 3 tips to find your own Price Guide and understand what a property may be worth:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Research and find the last 3 recent sales within 4km of the property you are wanting to buy</li>
              <li>Make sure the properties you find are similar in block size, internal size and layout</li>
              <li>Call 3 other sale agents who sell homes in the area and ask their opinion on what the property may be worth</li>
            </ol>

          <!-- Tip 4: Due Diligence -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">4</div>
            <h3>Due Diligence & Contracts</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike some other states, Queensland sellers do not need to give any previous or existing information about their property to the interested buyers. It is up to the buyers to complete their own due diligence on the property before the make an offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a buyer you can request information from the sales agent, but at times they may not have all the details you may require.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Here are some examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you are purchasing s property that is advertised as a dual occupancy home, you want to make sure that this has been approved by council and the seller has the correct permits and paperwork in place.</li>
              <li>Some properties may have had extensions or renovation work completed. Are they compliant and certified? This information and documentation will be approved by council and the seller will have these documents.</li>
              <li>If you are purchasing a house and would like to add another story, add a carport or even extend the home we suggest you engage with a town planner to ensure these can be completed and allowed by council.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>There are some certificates and documentation that the seller must supply:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Smoke alarms must be compliant and certified</li>
              <li>If there is a swimming pool on the property then a certificate of safety and compliance should be supplied</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Tip 5: Building & Pest -->
          <div class="tip-card">
            <div class="tip-number">5</div>
            <h3>Building & Pest Reports</h3>
            <p>
              As I am sure you would have heard, termites exist on the Gold Coast!! Therefore, we always recommend that you make your offer subject to a 7-day building and pest report, or if the property you want to buy is going to auction you complete your own building and pest inspection beforehand if the seller has not had one completed already.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your report comes back with any major defects or major termite damage, it gives you grounds to act on 1 of 3 options:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>You can terminate your contract and walk away from the purchase. You will receive your deposit back in full.</li>
              <li>You can have your conveyancer request a price adjustment to account for the major defect work that will be required on the property.</li>
              <li>Or; you can request that the seller attends these issues before settlement</li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Negotiating Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to negotiating with sale agents on the Gold Coast we recommend you utilise these 3 strategies to help you secure your new home.
          </p>

          <div class="strategy">
            <h4>Make a Ghost Offer</h4>
            <p>
              What does this mean? Do not be scared to put an offer on an EOI form and sign it. Unless your offer is on a formal contract and signed, it is not a legal agreement. Making a ghost offer will immediately ensure you get feedback from the sales agent in regard to what the seller is expecting for the home. From here you can begin the process in negotiating with a better understanding of the seller's expectations.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <h4>Submit your offer on email alongside 3 property links to recent sales in the area</h4>
            <p>
              Use these properties to justify your offer and give the sales agent what they need to groom the seller for your offer. The sales agent wants to sell the home, the more information you give them regarding recent sales and market statistics the better your offer will come across. Help them do their job!
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="strategy">
            <h4>Find out why they are selling. Some main reasons are:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Downsizing OR Upgrading</li>
              <li>Moving for work or lifestyle</li>
              <li>Financial stress</li>
              <li>Purchased somewhere else and need to sell</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This can help you position your offer that best suits the sellers needs. For example; if the seller has purchased somewhere else they will be in need for a quick settlement and would prefer a cash offer. Knowing the answer to this important question can help you leverage your offer and convince the seller to take your offer.

              Mermaid Beach got its name from the cutter HMS Mermaid, which explorer John Oxley sailed aboard in 1823 when he discovered the Brisbane and Tweed Rivers. Mermaid Beach is generally much quieter in contrast to its busy neighbours in Broadbeach and Surfers Paradise. This is likely due to the majority of the beach here being fronted by homes and units. Hedges Avenue runs parallel to the beach and has a dedicated pedestrian and bike lane, providing access to the beach at cross streets.

              Burleigh Heads, or simply 'Burleigh' to locals, sits like a cool comma between Surfers Paradise to the north and Coolangatta to the south. Burleigh Heads Beach enjoys dual popularity with those who like to swim in her protective waters and those who love to surf around the headland. On days when it might be a little choppy elsewhere, there's usually a protected corner at Burleigh to take a dip.

              'Palmy', as it's fondly known by locals, is patrolled by two surf lifesaving clubs, Palm Beach and Pacific Surf Life Saving Clubs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Palm Beach Surf Life Saving Club was established in 1930 by a group of lifesavers from Brisbane looking to start a new club. A tent in the sandhills behind the beach became their first clubhouse before they upgraded to a shack and patrol lookout tower. Today the club offers beachfront dining and an active Surf Life Saving community.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Palm Beach community is an example of laid-back living where iconic beach shacks meet multi-million dollar homes and apartments that line the beachfront. Shops and cafes are conveniently located within walking distance of the beach. Palmy has also built a name for itself as one of the city's up and coming dining precincts with trendy bars and restaurants regularly popping up.

              If you walk along the oceanfront through Queen Elizabeth Park on a sunny winter's day, you may just spot the pods of dolphins and migrating whales. Coolangatta has been a popular holiday destination since the late 1800s and promises a slower pace in comparison to the bustling centre of the Gold Coast a half-hour drive away.
            </p>

              Coolangatta Beach is surrounded by parklands that contain toilets, barbecues, tables, shade structures and beach showers. The oceanway runs along the beach, popular with walkers, riders and skateboarders. Coolangatta's main retail and commercial area is just across the road, with plenty of cafés and restaurants.
