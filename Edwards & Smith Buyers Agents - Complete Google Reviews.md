**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)  
**Date:** 2 months ago

> My wife Lauren and I recently had the pleasure of working with Jake to secure our new home, which we move into in just over a week. We've worked with other buyers agents before and the results have been just okay, Jake and his team really operate on another level.
>
> From start to finish, the attention to detail, responsiveness, and genuine care for their clients was so clear in everything they did. The whole process felt smooth and stress free, and we couldn't be happier with the outcome.
>
> Edwards and Smith Buyers Agents are the real deal, they're with you for the whole journey from point A to Z and not just A to B. Couldn't recommend them highly enough and will definitely be seeking them out again in the future.

**Reviewer:** Lauren Z (Local Guide, 13 reviews, 2 photos)  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)  
**Date:** 2 months ago

> My husband and I recently purchased our family home with Jake as our buyers agent, and we honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the very beginning, he was incredibly attentive and genuinely listened to what we were looking for. His knowledge of the market has made us feel confident every step of the way, and he always went the extra mile to make the whole process smooth and stress free. Nothing ever felt like too much trouble for him.
>
> In a market like this, we never thought it would be possible, but Jake helped us secure our home under budget and under market value! We're so grateful for his support and wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone looking to buy.

> Five-Star Buyer Agent Experience!
>
> Working with Jake and Kath was an absolute game-changer in our home-buying journey. From our very first meeting, it was clear that we were in the hands of a true professional—someone who not only knows the market inside and out, but also genuinely cares about their clients.
>
> They took the time to understand exactly what we were looking for, asked all the right questions, and offered expert advice. Their communication was flawless—always responsive, honest, and incredibly organized. They handled every step of the process and it felt entirely stress free.

>
> We couldn't be happier and would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a home. If you want someone who goes above and beyond, this is the buyer agent for you!

**Reviewer:** Ananya P (8 reviews, 1 photo)  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)  
**Date:** 5 months ago

> I went to Edwards & Smith in a bit of a crisis searching for property with tight personal constraints and I was working with Emma to get my purchase through.
>
> I cannot vouch for her enough, her professionalism, and a set of eyes and ears that are more experienced than mine and my partner's, and somehow came up with a result at a lower price point that reflected everything we wanted. Highly communicative and actively did her best to accommodate all of my idiosyncrasies.
>
> Emma is a great listener and really cares about her clients - though I'd never saying for a buyer's agent, but I don't think I've made a better decision during my house purchase journey.
>
> We are ring fans for a buyer's agent, and honestly I don't think I could have done it without Emma and Edwards and Smith.
>
> Cheers everyone.

> Edwards & Smith was highly recommended from the start of my partner and I'd property journey. Jake was our first point of contact and from the beginning, he was efficient, and understanding of our inexperience as first-time buyers. He quickly connected us with Dylan who was with us through every step of the process. We were absolutely thrilled with Dylan. From our first call with Jake to our loan approval, the entire process was simple and all handled with us. We couldn't have asked for a better team.

**Reviewer:** jessie butts (1 review)  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)  
**Date:** 5 months ago

> My husband and I were on the hunt for a set of townhouses to add to our investment portfolio. Being based in another state, we anticipated some challenges with researching and purchasing property remotely. That's why we decided to work with Ely, and we couldn't have made a better choice! From the very beginning, Ely impressed us with his professionalism, efficiency, and excellent communication, guiding us through each stage of the process. We were absolutely thrilled when Ely not only found us the perfect investment with just four weeks, but also negotiated an incredible deal that was $50k below the asking price. We highly recommend Ely and the entire team for their dedication and expertise!

> Jake was my first point of contact at Edwards & Smith, and from the start, he was professional, efficient, and incredibly understanding of my inexperience as a first-time buyer. He quickly connected me with Mackenzie, who guided me through every step of the process with patience and expertise. No question was too small—Mackenzie was always available, providing clear answers and reassurance whenever I needed it. From my first call with Jake to my loan approval, the entire process took just over four weeks. I couldn't have asked for a better team to help me secure my first home! Highly recommend 👍

**Date:** 2 years ago

> Great experience dealing with Edwards & Smith Buyers Agent.
>
> Jake was excellent in communicating and consistently touching base with us in regards to different options available but also took on our feedback if it was not suitable.
>
> Due to his great negotiation skills and persistence we purchased our dream home.
>
> Also it was not for Jake referring us to a very reputable mortgage broker after a bad experience dealing with another broker during our process we would not have been able to purchase our dream home.
>
> Look no further for a suitable buyers agent. Highly recommended.
>
> Will not disappoint.

> We worked with Emma to buy our first home and she was incredible! She listened to everything we wanted, took the time to find properties that ticked all of our boxes and never pressured us to make any decisions we weren't 100% on. When it finally came to signing contracts and finalising our purchase, Emma went above and beyond, explained contracts, and made the entire process so seamless. We are so grateful for her help as if it wasn't for Emma we would have never purchased!

## Review 20
**Reviewer:** Jc Maguire (7 reviews, 2 photos)  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)  
**Date:** 11 months ago

> After battling for several months to buy a townhouse I was very weary just trying to negotiate the price and close the sale.
>
> I rang Edwards & Smith who were referred to me by a Real Estate Agent, set up a meeting with Ely and within 3 weeks I had closed the sale on a townhouse in Cleveland. They took position. Ely's negotiating skills were amazing and the purchase price was well below the asking price - about $40k. Ely also smoothed out the bumps along the way to settlement day and believe me there were a few!! I am extremely happy with the service I received and my new home! Thanks Ely

**Response from the owner (10 months ago):** Thank you so much. You were amazing to work with!

**Date:** 9 months ago

> Always a great experience working with Ely and his team. Market knowledge is second to none with a highly efficient process in place to ensure no stone is left unturned in his search, as a result, Ely has purchased several properties through me off and on market for his clients. As an agent I deal with different buyers agents everyday so I can confidently say Ely is one of the best I have worked with. Looking forward to working together again soon!

**Response from the owner (9 months ago):** Appreciate your review Nicholas and we look forward to working closer with you in 2025 and beyond.

## Review 22
**Reviewer:** Alison Anderson (3 reviews)  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)  
**Date:** a year ago

> We can't thank Jake and his team enough for the wonderful service provided with buying our investment property. Living interstate proved difficult to find a property that suited our needs, but after several months of frustration and time wasting , we contacted Jake and his team. Within days we had multiple properties to look at and found what we were looking for within a few weeks . The communication was brilliant throughout the whole purchase and was well worth using a buyers agent to eliminate time, stress and inspections .This helped us make informed decisions and nothing was ever too much trouble.
>
> Thank you Jake and team , we will certainly use your services for our next purchase and will recommend you to friends and family . We would still be looking for a property if it wasn't for you !

**Response from the owner (a year ago):** Thank you Alison for your kind review. Working alongside you guys was amazing and we appreciated your trust in our ability to find your new home.

## Review 24
**Reviewer:** Veronica Cook (7 reviews)  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars)  
**Date:** a year ago

> From the moment I met Ely and Emma there was a connection. I was searching for a property on my own but when having endless grief with agents not returning calls or communicating...perhaps because the market is so active they didn't need me!
>
> Ely and Emma took all that grief away. After providing a brief on what we wanted, they swiftly moved into action. A property was located quickly, best of all at a price I couldn't have negotiated myself with agents, competing with the queues of people viewing similar homes. I believe we potentially saved $40k to $50k off market purchase price using Ely and Emma's services.
>
> To give Emma took the pain out of the experience. Time is valuable for me being a busy working mum running my own business and using the services of Edwards & Smith Buyers Agents without a doubt took away the world of hurt dealing with Real Estate agents.
>
> The continued arrangements of ESP and any other property access requirements were all handled by Ely and Emma, so I didn't have to locate these other services. They handled all the steps from finding property to settlement.
>
> The professionalism, integrity and communication displayed during the process was awesome... I was always kept updated. I wasn't chasing, which was refreshing.

> I have dealt with Jake and Jess on 2 occasions where I was the selling agent. Both times they have been able to secure a property off market for their clients effectively removing any competition from other buyers. They are extremely efficient and quick in responding to any issue that may occur. They represent their clients well and I have no issue in recommending them to any potential buyer I come across

**Response from the owner (a year ago):** Thank you so much Trent. We love working with you also in helping secure the perfect properties for our clients
